# Starvania_Assessment

This assessment has a total of seven problems you will need to solve. Each one of these problems will be used to assess your understanding, programming skills, and technical skills in Unity.

There are different ways to solve each problem. In this assessment, we will not be looking at the final results of your solutions only, but also at the quality of your code and the way you solved the problems in terms of performance as well.

Please follow the steps in order to complete the assessment:
- Go to the repository link in GitHub: https://github.com/latifa176/Starvania_Assessment and download the project as ZIP.
- Unzip the project folder and open it in Unity. (:warning: Make sure you open it using Unity version: **2020.3.2f1**. If you do not have this version, please install it before starting the project)
- Find the "Problem Description" PDF file in the Assets folder.
- Read the description for each problem before solving it.
- After solving all seven problems, create your own personal repository on GitHub (:warning: Make sure it is a private repository) and upload the whole Unity project onto it.
- Add these users as collaborators for your private repository: **latifa176**, **SuperMadio**.
(:warning: Please note that we will not be able to see your project unless you add the above users as collaborators)

**Deadline is 15-Sep-2022**

If you could not finish before then, please submit with what you have.
